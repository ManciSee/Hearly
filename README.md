## ðŸ’¡ Introduction
**Hearly** is a cloud-based platform developed as a project for the *Cloud Systems* course of the Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Catania. Its goal is to provide a simple and efficient service for **automatic transcription** and **summarization** of audio content by leveraging the power of cloud computing.

The platform allows users to upload audio files, which are processed through a distributed pipeline built on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Transcriptions are performed using AWS speech recognition services, while summaries are generated via **OpenAI on Azure**.
